\section{Comparison with cuBLAS and cuTENSOR}\label{sec:comparison}

This section compares optimised kernels with vendor-library baselines under
matched precision, layout assumptions, and workload definitions.

\subsection{Comparison Protocol}

For each workload class:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item run cuBLAS/cuTENSOR baseline,
  \item run custom unfused variant,
  \item run custom fused/layout-aware variant,
  \item report speedups and counter-based explanation.
\end{enumerate}

The strongest baseline per workload is used as denominator for reported speedup
to avoid optimistic bias.

\subsection{Interpretation Strategy}

Outperformance is interpreted by regime:

\begin{itemize}
  \item if custom kernels win in small sizes, launch reduction is the likely
    mechanism,
  \item if wins appear in medium sizes with high bandwidth utilisation, memory
    access improvements are the likely mechanism,
  \item if libraries remain dominant at larger sizes, this indicates the
    practical limit of workload-specific optimisation.
\end{itemize}
