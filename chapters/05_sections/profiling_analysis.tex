\section{Profiling Analysis}\label{sec:profiling}

Nsight Compute data is used to explain \emph{why} performance changes after each
optimisation, not only \emph{how much} it changes.

\subsection{Primary Counter Groups}

The analysis focuses on:

\begin{itemize}
  \item achieved occupancy and active warps,
  \item SM and tensor-core utilisation,
  \item global-memory throughput and L2 hit rate,
  \item warp stall breakdown (memory, dependency, barrier, dispatch),
  \item shared-memory bank-conflict indicators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attribution Method}

For each optimisation step, counters are compared before/after under identical
workload settings. A claimed optimisation mechanism is accepted only if the
relevant counter movement is consistent with the performance change.
