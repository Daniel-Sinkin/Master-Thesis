\section{Single-GPU Performance}\label{sec:single-gpu}

Single-device performance is reported for the target kernel set, with custom
implementations compared against cuBLAS/cuTENSOR baselines.

\subsection{Metrics}

The primary metrics are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item runtime per operation,
  \item achieved throughput (GFLOP/s or TFLOP/s),
  \item effective memory bandwidth,
  \item speedup relative to the strongest baseline.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Dimensions}

Results are stratified by:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item problem size regime (small, medium),
  \item precision mode (FP64, FP32, optional TF32),
  \item kernel variant (baseline, memory-optimised, fused).
\end{enumerate}

The split separates gains from arithmetic optimisation and gains from reduced
launch overhead.
