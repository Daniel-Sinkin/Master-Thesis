\section{Scaling Behaviour}\label{sec:scaling}

The analysis tracks how performance evolves when moving from one GPU to
multiple GPUs within a single NVLink-connected node.

\subsection{Strong and Weak Scaling Views}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strong scaling:} fixed total problem size, increasing GPU
    count.
  \item \textbf{Weak scaling:} per-GPU problem size fixed, total size increases
    with GPU count.
\end{itemize}

Both views are needed because kernel-level speedups may not translate linearly
once communication and synchronisation costs are included.

\subsection{Communication Effects}

Scaling analysis explicitly separates:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item pure compute time on each GPU,
  \item peer-to-peer transfer time over NVLink,
  \item host-side orchestration and synchronisation overhead.
\end{enumerate}

The decomposition identifies when scaling is limited by communication topology
rather than kernel efficiency.
