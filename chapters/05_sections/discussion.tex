\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

The discussion synthesises kernel-level and system-level findings into
actionable guidance for future optimisation cycles.

\subsection{What Improved and Why}

The main question is not only whether performance improved, but which mechanism
was responsible (launch reduction, memory locality, occupancy tuning, or
precision mode selection). Profiling evidence is used to support each claim.

\subsection{Transferability}

Improvements are classified as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{portable} (likely to transfer across Ampere-like systems),
  \item \textbf{topology-sensitive} (dependent on node NUMA/NVLink structure),
  \item \textbf{workload-specific} (effective only for the studied contraction
    distribution).
\end{itemize}
