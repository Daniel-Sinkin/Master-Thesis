\section{Baseline Selection}\label{sec:baseline}

To make performance claims meaningful, all custom kernels are compared against
well-defined baselines under matched problem sizes, precision, and memory
layout assumptions.

\subsection{Primary Baselines}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{cuBLAS:} reference for GEMM-like contraction kernels.
  \item \textbf{cuTENSOR:} reference for direct tensor contraction and
    permutation-centric workflows.
  \item \textbf{cuBLASDx compositions:} reference for device-side small-GEMM
    execution where launch amortisation is central.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fairness Criteria}

Each comparison uses:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item identical input tensors and dimensions,
  \item identical precision modes and accumulation rules,
  \item warm-up runs and repeated measurements for variance control,
  \item consistent stream and synchronisation semantics.
\end{enumerate}

Reported metrics include median runtime, throughput (GFLOP/s or TFLOP/s),
effective memory bandwidth, and speedup relative to the strongest baseline per
workload.
